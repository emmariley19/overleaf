\multicolumn{3}{p{14cm}}{All regressions include a full set of household control variables from table \ref{HH sum} and errors clustered at the village level.  All regressions also control for village characteristics which could affect the ease of sending remittances. These are the distance to the nearest main road, distance to nearest population centre and distance to nearest market, as well as having an ATM, bank or post office in the village.Village MM use refers to the proportion of households in the village using mobile money. MM use is a dummy variable equal to one if that household uses mobile money. The distance to the agent is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the agent is within that distance of the village.} \\
