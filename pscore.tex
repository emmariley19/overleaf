\multicolumn{5}{p{12cm}}{ Difference-in-difference and difference-in-difference with household fixed effects regressions using frequency weights from nearest neighbour propensity score matching. Village clustered standard errors in brackets and full set of control variables from Table \ref{HH sum}. All regressions also control for village characteristics which could affect the ease of sending remittances. These are the distance to the nearest main road, distance to nearest population centre and distance to nearest market, as well as having an ATM, bank or post office in the village. Village MM refers to the proportion of households in the village using mobile money. MM use is a dummy variable equal to one if that household uses mobile money. The top 5\% of the consumption distribution had been truncated since there are no households in the non-user sample with incomes that high.} \\
