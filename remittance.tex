\multicolumn{3}{p{11cm}}{Full set of control variables as in Table \ref{HH sum} and errors clustered at the village level. All regressions also control for village characteristics which could affect the ease of sending remittances. These are the distance to the nearest main road, distance to nearest population centre and distance to nearest market. MM use is a dummy variable equal to one if the household used mobile money in a given year.} \\
