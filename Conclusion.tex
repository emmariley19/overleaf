Even if idiosyncratic shocks are shared perfectly within the village, households in developing countries are still subject to large changes in consumption due to aggregate shocks, such as rainfall shocks, which negatively affect the consumption of the entire village at one. Droughts and floods are a major source of risk to developing households, and measures which help protect against these, ranging from social protection to micro-insurance, are key areas of research. Mobile money services are a new and fast growing technology which can help households insure their consumption against aggregate shocks by providing access to remittances.

In this paper I show that idiosyncratic shocks are perfectly insured at the village level but that large rainfall shocks negatively affect household consumption, therefore confirming the predictions of the Mace (1991) model. I then look at the impact mobile money use has on consumption in communities with mobile money, comparing users and non-users. I find that consumption per capita is higher for all households in communities with mobile money. However, when it comes to smoothing aggregate shocks, only mobile money users are  able to smooth their consumption after the shock. 

I confirm the robustness of my findings using a placebo test from before the introduction of mobile money to test the common trends assumption, instrumental variable techniques to address potential self-selection effects into mobile money use and propensity score matching to overcome selection bias based on observable covariates. All of these confirm my results. 

I check the proposed mechanism that the consumption smoothing effect is due to households that use mobile money receiving remittances, by looking at the value of remittances received in the final wave of data. I look at the correlation of migration with having a mobile money agent in the village, and the impact of distance to the nearest agent on consumption smoothing after an aggregate shock. I extend my results by looking at urban and rural households and droughts and floods separately. I find suggestive evidence that it is principally rural mobile-money-using households that benefit from improved ability to smooth rainfall shocks and who also share remittances with their communities when an aggregate shock hasn't occurred. It is principally droughts which negatively affect consumption and that are smoothed when a household uses mobile money. I also confirm my results extend to other types of aggregate shock.  

Research on the impact of mobile money services is still in its infancy. Further work could explore in more detail how access and use of mobile money services changes traditional risk sharing arrangements and who the winners and losers are from this. While this work has looked at the benefits of mobile money services at the level of the household, interesting further work would examine how these benefits are distributed within the household and how mobile money services affect intra-household decision making.
